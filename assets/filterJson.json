He is often associated with the concept of \"irrational exuberance,\" a phrase he used in 1996 to describe asset bubbles in the stock market. His tenure was marked by debates over the Fed's role in regulating the economy, particularly regarding the financial crisis of 2008, where critics pointed to his policies as contributing factors. After leaving the Fed, Greenspan continued to engage in economic commentary, authoring books and providing insights on global economic issues.
